### Drivetrain

After hours of discussion and brainstorming, we decided to use a GoBilda Mecanum Drivetrain for our robot this season. The reason for this choice is that it is easier to control and has a wide range of movement. 

At first, we decided to create a differential swerve drivetrain because of the high precision it has. We knew it would be extremely difficuly because it has a very complex system. It would be hard to program and build. 

As we went on, we changed to a mecanum drivetrain because we also had 2 years of experience with it, so it would be easier to program. All in all, our final drive train is a GoBilda Mecanum Drivetrain using the Gobilda Strafer Kit. Here is a picture of our drivetrain:

### Krispy Kreme

In previous years, we did not have as much fundraising as we would like. Since we realized that all expenses should be made up for, we decided to fundraise much more this season. 

One way we have fundraised for our team is Krispy Kreme Fundraisers. On their website, we discovered that they had a fundraising program for orginizations to raise money. After deciding to join this program, we emailed Krispy Kreme about joining the program.
