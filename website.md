### Drivetrain

After hours of discussion and brainstorming, we decided to use a GoBilda Mecanum Drivetrain for our robot this season. The reason for this choice is that it is easier to control and has a wide range of movement. 

At first, we decided to create a differential swerve drivetrain because of the high precision it has. We knew it would be extremely difficult because it has a very complex system. It would be hard to program and build. 

As we went on, we changed to a mecanum drivetrain because we also had 2 years of experience with it, so it would be easier to program. All in all, our final drive train is a GoBilda Mecanum Drivetrain using the Gobilda Strafer Kit. Here is a picture of our drivetrain:

### Arm

Our two main options for the arm for the robot to grab and put the game element (a cone) on top of the junctions were
A Linear Slide 
A Robotic Arm with an Elbow 
At first we wanted to use the expandable elbow, however we quickly realized that this was impractical, and was too heavy to support the claw. We are working on making our Linear Slide Arm design, however this should be significantly easier to add and optimize to our robot. We have decided to add an actuator to the arm, to provide extra support to the Linear Slide so weight isn’t as large an issue. 

### Claw

Our claw design is a very simple and straightforward design, to hold the cone (game element) in place. It consists of two servos attached to our arm, with base plates that can move in and out to tightly or loosely grab onto the cone to mount it on top of the junction. We are currently experimenting with different shapes for our claw to find out the best type of plate to grab the cone with the best grip and friction possible.

## Fundraising

### Emailing Large Tech Companies

We created a list of possible companies to email in hope to get sponsorships, which we would then give them possible benefits, and advertising in return, however with a main intent to support our team, and to help us support STEM and use the money for both the robot, and for outreach events. When we put this plan into action, emailing around 20 companies, we realized this approach was NOT of use, and was not helpful at all. We received emails back from one company, and they respectfully declined. We understood that this was not the approach, and didn’t bother with another round. 

### Krispy Kreme

In previous years, we did not have as much fundraising as we would like. Since we realized that all expenses should be made up for, we decided to fundraise much more this season. 

One way we have fundraised for our team is Krispy Kreme Fundraisers. On their website, we discovered that they had a fundraising program for organizations to raise money. There is a very convenient program called Digital Dozens which allows online fundraising, and involves sending coupons to customers, at a discounted price for them. We managed to buy a dozen doughnuts for $6.50 each, and sell the codes for around $11-13, when buying retail would cost the customer $17. This managed to be a win-win for both us and the customer. This helped us sell a lot more doughnuts than we would have been able to with a basic fundraiser, or without a discount. We have sold around 40 dozens so far, and are projected to make around a $200 profit. 

### Sponsorships at the Mall


## Outreach

### CAD Temple Event
We plan to hold an event teaching CAD to kids at the Fremont Hindu Temple. Anyone is welcome to join, and this could either be a one-time event, or a weekly thing. This depends on how this goes.

### Java Classes
We have created an in-depth curriculum on the basics of Java, and sent out sign ups led by one of our team members, and these classes will occur once a week, over a period of time around 1-2 months.

### Python Classes
We have created an in-depth curriculum on the basics of Python, and sent out sign ups led by one of our team members, and these classes will occur once a week, over a period of time around 1-2 months.

# Ultimate Goal

This was our rookie year, so we did not know much. For example, we did not have a clue which kit we should buy for our robot. After some research, we saw that Tetrix was a good kit to buy. We then bought the kit, and started to build our robot.

### Drivetrain

This season is our rookie year. We do not have a lot of experience in robotics, but after conducting some research, we decided to build a mecanum drivetrain because it was quite simple. It also gets the job done with precise movement.

## Software

For our autonomous code this season, we used roadrunner. Roadrunner is a trajectory which allows users to create a path for your robot. We have our three paths for our autonomous trajectories:

Path A:


Path B:


Path C:



## Fundraising

We received a $1500 grant from apple after we applied for it. We could only use this money on supplies from Tetrix. We bought our drivetrain set, which includes the mecanum wheels and the bars for the drivetrain. We also bought our control hub and expansion hub using this money. Also, we bought the FTC Tetrix kit and other small parts that we had to buy after because of a change in our design.

## Outreach

We have three outreach events this season. One is a FIRST Seminar, Java Classes, and our Youtube Channel.
