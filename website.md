### Drivetrain

After hours of discussion and brainstorming, we decided to use a GoBilda Mecanum Drivetrain for our robot this season. The reason for this choice is that it is easier to control and has a wide range of movement. At first, we decided to create a differential swerve drivetrain because of the high precision it has. We knew it would be extremely difficuly because it has a very complex system. It would be hard to program and build. As we went on, we changed to a mecanum drivetrain because we also had 2 years of experience with it, so it would be easier to program. All in all, our final drive train is a GoBilda Mecanum Drivetrain using the Gobilda Strafer Kit. Here is a picture of our drivetrain:
